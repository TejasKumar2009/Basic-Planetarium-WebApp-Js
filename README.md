# Basic-Planetarium-WebApp-Js
This is a very basic planetarium software made using html, css and Js. This is made using external APIs like Math.js and Solar System Scope !!!

This web application has very basic features like the simulation of our solar system using Solar System Scope Embedded link.

This web application has also some basic features which will be made more accurate and more features will be added.

  This web application has a feature of "Planetary Alignment Estimation" by which we can select a date in which
  a particular planetary alignment has taken place (We can select two or even more than two planets) and then
  we can see the next date at which the same planetary alignment will take place.This basic feature has been developed by using the concept of LCM.
